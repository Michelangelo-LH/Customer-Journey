# Customer-Journey
Communications - Touch points. A touchpoint is any time a potential customer or customer comes in contact with your brandâ€“before, during, or after they purchase something from you.

# Idea
React app that visualizes the customer journey lifecycle for an OTA hotels and flights product. The app should categorize customers into different segments based on their intents and communication preferences. You want to use a JSON format to define and index these segments for comparison filtering. Additionally, you want to create dedicated components for each user segment and use Valtio for managing component states. The touchpoints should be customizable, categorizable, labeled, and tagged within the JSON file. The customer journey should be divided into phases: Inception, Dreaming, Planning, Booking, Experiencing, and Sharing.

# To do
Define the JSON structure: Create a JSON file that represents the customer segments, touchpoints, and phases

Build the React components: Create dedicated components for each user segment based on the JSON structure. For example, you can create a UserSegment component that takes the segment data as props and renders the segment's touchpoints. Use React hooks to manage the component states.

Use Valtio for component states: Install Valtio (a lightweight proxy-based state manager) in your project. Create a Valtio store object to hold the state of the touchpoints. Each touchpoint can have a boolean value indicating whether it is selected or not. You can update the state based on user interactions, such as toggling a touchpoint on or off. Build the dedicated components for each user segment, you can leverage React hooks like useState and useEffect to manage component states and perform side effects, such as fetching data or updating the Valtio store.

Render the customer journey visualization: Use chart libraries like react-chartjs-2 or recharts to visualize the customer journey. Create a chart component that displays the phases on the x-axis and the selected touchpoints on the y-axis. Map over the customer segments, retrieve the selected touchpoints from the Valtio store, and display them on the chart. For rendering the chart component, you can choose from various chart libraries like Chart.js, recharts, or Victory. These libraries provide robust charting capabilities and should be suitable for visualizing the customer journey phases and selected touchpoints.

Implement touchpoint customization: Add functionality to add and remove touchpoints dynamically. When adding a touchpoint, update the JSON file with the new touchpoint details. When removing a touchpoint, update the JSON file by removing the touchpoint entry.

Categorize, label, and tag touchpoints: Add additional properties to the touchpoint objects in the JSON file to categorize, label, and tag them. For example, you can add a "category" property to group touchpoints into categories like email, social, notifications, etc.

Customize touchpoints in JSON file: Update the JSON file to include the touchpoint customization properties such as category, label, and tags. You can modify the touchpoints in the JSON file directly or build a separate form component that allows users to modify touchpoint properties and updates the JSON file accordingly.

# Strcuture
Here's a breakdown of the main folders and files:

index.html: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for your React application.
package-lock.json and package.json: Files used by npm to manage dependencies and scripts for your project.

postcss.config.js: Configuration file for PostCSS, a tool used for transforming CSS.

public: A directory where static assets like images or fonts can be placed.
src: The main directory where your project's source code resides.

App.jsx: The main component representing your application.

assets: A directory for storing static assets specific to your application, such as images or icons.

components: A directory where you can place reusable React components used throughout your application.

config: A directory where you can store configuration files or data. It contains the 

customerSegmentsTouchpoints.json file.

index.css: CSS file for global styles that apply to your entire application.

main.jsx: The entry point for your React application, where you render the main App component.

pages: A directory where you can organize your application's pages or views.

store: A directory for managing application state, which could include files related to Valtio or other state management solutions.

tailwind.config.js: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.

vite.config.js: Configuration file for Vite, the build tool used for your React project.

You can start building your customer journey lifecycle visualization app within the existing project structure. Consider creating appropriate components, such as CustomerSegment and Touchpoint, and importing the necessary data from the customerSegmentsTouchpoints.json file to render the visualization dynamically.
